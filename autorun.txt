//save this as super.sh
//and add this also in crontab
We need to make the launcher script an executable, which we do with this command
chmod 755 super.sh
Now test it, by typing in:
sh super.sh
//AND FINALLY
Type in:
sudo crontab -e
This will brings up a crontab window.

Now, enter the line:
@reboot sh /home/pi/Desktop.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1
What this does is rather than executing the launcher script at a specific time, it will execute it once upon startup.
